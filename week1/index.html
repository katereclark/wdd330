        </header>
        <main>
            <h2>Exercise(s)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="story-editor.html">Exercise 1: Story Writer</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Do we need to write notes or can we just do 1+ exercise(s)?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Design for smallest device first (mobile first)</li>
                <li>Responsive retrofitting - addresses constraints of mobile size and bandwidth as opposed to simply making something work for mobile</li>
                <li>Start small and scale up - content and functionality focus</li>
                <li>Observe what people are doing rather than just what they are saying that they want</li>
                <li>Immediate. Relevant. Frictionless.</li>
                <li>Provide users with what they want as fast as possible to be useful</li>
                <li>Make something 0 steps when possible</li>
                <li>Take reachability into account - put key items at the bottom</li>
                <li>Speed matters (even half a second)</li>
                <li>Network is one of the greatest factors on speed</li>
                <li>Reduce image usage (and use SVG and webfonts)</li>
                <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
                <li>Primary controls - move nav and subnav to bottom on mobile</li>
                <li>Easy to reach primary controls leads to a perception of speed and improved engagement and satisfaction</li>
                <li>Using the word 'menu' with a border around it is the most understandable form rather than a hamburger menu icon</li>
                <li>Focus on the important things first and simple to decrease cognitive load when using forms</li>
                <li>Only add info that is absolutely required and needed</li>
                <li>Make fields taller in forms and put labels inside input box and use a float label that moves up in box when selected</li>
                <li>Add progress indicator and enable autocomplete on forms</li>
                <li>Do not mask passwords - show by default but add the option to hide it if they want</li>
                <li>Autoadvance to next field and add spaces in form, especially with card information</li>
                <li>Don't bring up standard keyboard if onyl need number input - use telephone keypad instead</li>
                <li>Link phone numbers in anchor tag instead of just the text so people don't have to copy and paste it</a></li>
                <li>Do not use pop-ups, especially on mobile sites</li>
                <li>Make adds small and simple (thin until clicked)</li>
                <li>Use ads that are underneath the content and are viewed through a mirror window as the user scrolls to read</li>
                <li>Make ads appropriate for the given content and create empathy by connecting the two</li>
                <li>Content first, ads second</li>
            </ul>
