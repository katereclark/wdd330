            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>What are some other good TDD JS libraries?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>System error ― there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
                <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
                </li>
                <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
                <li>Ensure that code fails loudly in development so errors can be found quickly</li>
                <li>Make code fail gracefully but not completely silently, and so as to not affect user experience</li>
                <li>Strict mode - produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features - throws errors if sloppy code is used</li>
                <li>'use strict'</li>
                <li>self-invoking function - (function() {
                    'use strict';}());</li>
                <li>Linting tools (lint test) - highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed - enforce style guide</li>
                <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. </li>
                <li>Modernizr is a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection and Can I Use? is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.</li>
                <li> In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated</li>
                <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code - alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked</li>
                <li>console.trace() method - will log an interactive stack trace in the console.</li>
                <li>debugger keyword - will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to</li>
                <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function</li>
                <li>EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError</li>
                <li>These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects: const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');</li>
                <li>throw statement - throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');</li>
                <li>try, catch, anf finally</li>
                <li>Testdriven development (TDD) - write tests that initially fail, write code to pass the tests, refactor the code, test refactored code, write more test for new features (red-green-refactor)</li>
                <li>testing frameworks - Jest ( jest -c {} ), run files that end in test.js within that folder</li>
                <li>test('non-numerical data returns not prime', () => {
                    expect(isPrime('two')).toBe(false);
                });</li>
            </ul>
